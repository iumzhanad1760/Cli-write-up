### Context
In this CLI writeu i will write about what we did in this unit. what is CLI, my challanges and also takeaways. 
At first CLI stands for a ** command line interface **  and it is a text-based interface where you can input commands that interact with a computer's operating system. The CLI operates with the help of the default shell, which is between the operating system and the user.

### About 
#### - here is my vocabulary 
```pwd```Print working directory and tells you where are you (the file path)

```ls```-List directory and list of contents of your current directory

```cd```-Change directory and navigate that directory 

```cd..```- represents parent directory and goes up one level to parent directory

```Cd ~ ``` - goes home

```..``` - goes to parent directory

```mkdir```- Make  directory 

```rmdir```- Remove directory ( that is empty)

```touch```- make file 

```rm```- Remove 

```rm -rf```- remove folder

```mv```- to rename

```mv```- to move




 ### _examples_
Cd brooklyn- goes into the child directory called “Brooklyn”

Cd brooklyn /bay ridge- Goes into grandchild directory called bay ridge via child directory- Brooklyn 

cd../sunset park

## Challenges
1. My first challenge was during the music CLI classwork. i was trying to put file  ```blink-182.txt``` in the folder ```punk-rock``` but it didnt work
because i wasn´ in the right directory.

So after i wrote ```cd wd/classwork/cli-music-iumzhanad1760/punk-rock``` it fixed my code to this and everythng began to work.
