# Process Writeup
## Name: Iumzhana Dambaeva
## Course: SEP
## Period: 8th
## Concept: CLI

## Context
In this _CLI_ writeu I will write about what we did in this unit. What is _CLI_, my challenges, and also takeaways? 
At first, _CLI_ stands for a **command line interface**, and it is a text-based interface where you can input commands that interact with a computer's operating system. The CLI operates with the help of the default shell, which is between the operating system and the user.

## About 
### - Here is my vocabulary 
```pwd```Print the working directory and tell you where you are (the file path).

```ls```-List directory and list of contents of your current directory

```cd```-Change directory and navigate that directory

```cd..```—represents the parent directory and goes up one level to the parent directory.

```Cd ~``` - goes home

```..``` - goes to parent directory

```mkdir``` - Make directory 

```rmdir``` - Remove directory (that is empty)

```touch``` - make file 

```rm```- Remove 

```rm -rf```- remove folder

```mv``` - to rename

```mv``` - to move




 ### _examples_
Cd Brooklyn goes into the child directory called “Brooklyn.”

Cd Brooklyn/Bay Ridge goes into the grandchild directory called Bay Ridge via the child directory, Brooklyn. 

cd ../sunset park

## Challenges

#### 1.
My first challenge was during the music CLI classwork. I was trying to put the file ```blink-182.txt``` in the folder ```punk-rock```, but it didn't work.
because I wasn't in the right directory.

So after I wrote ```cd wd/classwork/cli-music-iumzhanad1760/punk-rock```, it fixed my code to this, and everything began to work. 
    
    
- right code above.

#### 2.
 My second challenge was that I was confused about ```mv```. I was trying to put ```blink-182.txt``` in the folder ```punk-rock```, but I accidentally wrote ```pank-rock```, and it just renamed my file, and I had to rename it back in order to make it right.

I used ```mv punk-rock blink-182.txt``` to rename it and ```mv blink-182.txt punk-rock``` to move it to the right folder.

And this is the right result! 

## Takeaway
From my challenges, we can clearly understand that knowledge of MV is really important because it is a little different from others because it has 2 meanings, and you need to make sure that you already have your folder or the name of the folder written correctly to not confuse yourself and make your work faster. And also one small takeaway from this unit is the importance of double-checking your directory before running commands in the CLI. Navigating to the correct folder is key to ensuring that file operations, like moving or renaming files, work as intended.
Thank you!
