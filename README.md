## Challenges
1. My first challenge was during the music CLI classwork. i was trying to put file  ```blink-182.txt``` in the folder ```punk-rock``` but it didnt work
because i wasn´ in the right directory.

So after i wrote ```cd wd/classwork/cli-music-iumzhanad1760/punk-rock``` it fixed my code to this and everythng began to work.
