### Context
In this _CLI_ writeu i will write about what we did in this unit. what is _CLI_, my challanges and also takeaways. 
At first _CLI_ stands for a **command line interface**  and it is a text-based interface where you can input commands that interact with a computer's operating system. The CLI operates with the help of the default shell, which is between the operating system and the user.

### About 
#### - here is my vocabulary 
```pwd```Print working directory and tells you where are you (the file path)

```ls```-List directory and list of contents of your current directory

```cd```-Change directory and navigate that directory 

```cd..```- represents parent directory and goes up one level to parent directory

```Cd ~ ``` - goes home

```..``` - goes to parent directory

```mkdir```- Make  directory 

```rmdir```- Remove directory ( that is empty)

```touch```- make file 

```rm```- Remove 

```rm -rf```- remove folder

```mv```- to rename

```mv```- to move




 ### _examples_
Cd brooklyn- goes into the child directory called “Brooklyn”

Cd brooklyn /bay ridge- Goes into grandchild directory called bay ridge via child directory- Brooklyn 

cd../sunset park

## Challenges
1. My first challenge was during the music CLI classwork. i was trying to put file  ```blink-182.txt``` in the folder ```punk-rock``` but it didnt work
because i wasn´ in the right directory.

So after i wrote ```cd wd/classwork/cli-music-iumzhanad1760/punk-rock``` it fixed my code to this and everythng began to work. 
    
    
- right code above.

2. My second challenge was that i was confused about ```mv``` i was trying to put ```blink-182.txt``` in the folder ```punk-rock``` but accidentally wrote  ```pank-rock``` and it just remaned my file and i had to remane it back in order to make it right.

i used  ``` mv pank-rock blink-182.txt```   to remane it and ```mv blink-182.txt punk-rock``` to move it to a right folder.
